                    <h2>A Mother's Love</h2>
                    <h5><i>October 4th, 2020 by Javian Anderson</i></h5>

                    <p>There is nothing that can come close to the love that a mother feels for her children. Women are inherently good mothers. 
                        Till birth women carry their young and then continue their love & affection throughout their childhood and even into adulthood. 
                        Every Mother always makes sure that their children are safe and happy throughout their childhood. It is the love for their 
                        child that a mother feels that drives these feelings. No one can describe in words the feeling that a mother has towards her 
                        children. In fact, most people do not understand unless they become a mother themselves. Love always encourages us in any falls 
                        which come in life. She is the only person who has no demands except our best future.
                    </p>
                    <p>A Mother always wants best for her child and never compromise on anything related to her child.
                        Parents protect their child from any difficult situation and provide him all comfort that they can afford.
                        Mothers love is not only about pampering her child but also about letting her child know the moral and cultural values.
                        A good upbringing makes the better future of a person and a mother does an excellent job to give the best future for her child.
                        She converts a house into a home; she works as a superwoman because to keep managing household works and to fulfill all family members’ requirement on time is no easy task at all.
                        If we talk about working ladies than we can’t even imagine how she would manage all things together.
                        I am proud of my mother who has nurtured me along with doing a job and also managing home properly.

                    <h2>Trusting in the Lord</h2>
                    <h5><i>October 4th,2020 by Javian Anderson</i></h5>
                    <img src="trust.jpg" alt="Trust in God" class="float2">
                    <p>
                        Sometimes what we want in life, isn't what is best for us. Additionally, we often times overshadow what we want compared
                        to what God wants in our life. As we live we learn, and as I have learned in life, especially this past week,
                        we contradict ourselves almost all the time. God has a purpose for all of us. He has told us to always lean on him and trust
                        in him and I pause to ask, do we always? When we pray for him to guide our lives and his will to be done, do we have the patience to
                        see it through and wait on him? I know for me, I don't most times if not always. We pray for something and then go out of our way to 
                        do what we want, and often times than not, it wasn't what The Lord Wanted.          
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I urge you all to trust in him wholeheartedly. Trusting God is one of those truths we think we understand until we are called upon to do it, and then we discover that there
                        is more to it than we realized. Trusting God is an aspect of saving faith which has been said to have three elements to it: 
                        knowledge, assent, and trust.All three aspects go together, but without trust, faith is inadequate and shockingly indistinguishable from the faith of demons who believe and shudder
                        before God, yet do not repent and surrender themselves to him.
